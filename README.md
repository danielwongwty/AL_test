# AL_test

In Python or C++ write a module or small library which shows how you would take a set of personal data, where each record contains:

- name
- address
- phone number

And:

- build a simple API allowing you to add new records, filter users (e.g "name=Joe*") based on some simple search syntax like Glob.
- support serialisation in 2 or more formats (e.g JSON, Yaml, XML, CSV etc)
- Display the data in 2 or more different output formats (no need to use a GUI Framework, use e.g text output/HTML or any other human readable format).
- Add a command line interface to add records, and display/convert/filter the whole data set

Write it in such a way that it would be easy for a developer to extend the system e.g

- to add support for additional storage formats
- to query a list of currently supported formats

This should ideally show Object-Oriented Design and Design Patterns Knowledge, weâ€™re not looking for use of advanced Language constructs.

Please provide reasonable Unit Test coverage and basic API documentation

The task is designed to allow you some flexibility in how you design and implement it, and you should submit something that demonstrates your abilities and/or values as a Software Engineer.

On average, we would expect 4 to 8 hours work to complete this task - no need to make it too complicated.
